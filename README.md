# Python-Math

This is intended to develop into a math processing program that can walk through steps in math and show students how to work out basic problems. At the start, it will simply compute answers but I plan to build into the program outputs that will show how to set up a problem and work through each step.

This will also be my first Python program built from scratch. Started 9/12/22.

As of 10/12/22 the Python Program was successfully running the basic math calculations, though I had not gotten to add the pieces of showing the steps yet.

I found that my Python skills were too limited to make the program public easily, and I intend to get back to resolving that problem. However, for now (as of 10/17/22) I am working to convert the program to JavaScript as it is easier to publish with my current skill set.
