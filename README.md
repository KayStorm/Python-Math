# Python-Math

This is intended to develop into a math processing program that can walk through steps in math and show students how to work out basic problems. At the start, it will simply compute answers but I plan to build into the program outputs that will show how to set up a problem and work through each step.

This will also be my first Python program built from scratch. Started 9/12/22.
